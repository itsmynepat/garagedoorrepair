    <h2>Understanding Garage Door Springs</h2>
<p>Garage doors typically utilize two types of springs: <strong>torsion springs</strong> and <strong>extension springs</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Torsion Springs:</strong> These are mounted above the garage door and are responsible for lifting the door by twisting and storing energy.</li>
  <li><strong>Extension Springs:</strong> Located on either side of the door, these springs stretch to help lift the door.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both types of springs are under high tension and can be dangerous if not handled properly. Regular maintenance and timely replacement are crucial for ensuring safety and functionality.</p>
<h2>Why You Might Need Spring Replacement</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why you may need to replace your garage door springs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wear and Tear:</strong> Over time, springs can lose their tension due to regular use, leading to malfunction.</li>
  <li><strong>Temperature Changes:</strong> Fluctuations in temperature can affect the lifespan of your springs, causing them to break.</li>
  <li><strong>Improper Installation:</strong> If the springs were not installed correctly initially, they may fail prematurely.</li>
  <li><strong>Age:</strong> Most garage door springs have a lifespan of about 10,000 cycles; once they reach this limit, they should be replaced.</li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Door Won't Open or Close:</strong> A broken spring will prevent your garage door from functioning correctly.</li>
  <li><strong>Uneven Door Movement:</strong> If your garage door moves unevenly or appears crooked when opening or closing, it may indicate a spring issue.</li>
